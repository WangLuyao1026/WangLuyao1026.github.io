### 🛠 Action & Strategy
* **Public Opinion Monitoring:** Utilized intelligent algorithms to capture real-time legal hot topics on Weibo and Douyin, identifying potential risks.
* **Data-Driven Operation:** Analyzed user engagement metrics to adjust content strategies. For a specific public interest litigation video, I optimized the **hashtag selection** based on data feedback.

### 📈 Results
* **30% Growth:** The optimized video achieved a **30% increase** in click-through rate and views.
* **High Impact:** The official account ranked in the **Top 20** of the national procuratorial system for 16 consecutive months.
